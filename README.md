# EarhquakeNotificationSystem
Discrete Event Simulation–based Earthquake Notification System. The program processes earthquake data and user requests from two time-ordered input files. Events are handled chronologically starting from time 0, simulating real-time behavior via hourly steps or event-driven time jumps.
